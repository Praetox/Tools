A simple app that parses image filenames by the entered mask,
thus extracting metadata in the form of tags. Currently it's
limited to categorizing these tags. In the upcoming versions,
the app will organize the images using the collected tags,
finally embedding the tags into the image as emTags.

The app will be posted on praetox.com when it's done. Until
then, updates / status reports can be found on ptforums.net.
Sorry for any gui issues, these are temporary.

HOW TO USE THIS SHIT.

1. Extract and start the application.
2. If you have started organizing tags, click
   "Resume sorting or..." and skip to step #9.
3. Click the "..." button to select a directory with images.
4. Click "Select this folder" to continue.
5. Enter the name mask (see below for explanation)
6. Fill in the character that splits each tag
7. If any characters needs to be replaced in each tag, fill
   in the character to replace and the character to replace
   it with. abc in the first field and xyz in the second
   replaces all a's with x, all b's with y and all... yeah.
8. Click "Start collecting tags" and wait as it ZOOMs on.

9. Click any tag in the "0 // Tags // Unsorted" list, then
   use hotkeys or buttons to sort the tags. See below for
   hotkeys list.
A. Remember to click "Save tags/types" before you close!
B. Exit SS by clicking "Cancel". You may continue later.



HOTKEYS FUCK YEAR.

  Enter - Tags/Unsorted
  [F1]  - Tags/General
  [F2]  - Tags/Source
  [F3]  - Tags/Characters
  [F4]  - Tags/Artists
  [F5]  - Junk
  [ESC] - Undo
  [F9]  - Save



ABOUT NAME MASKS.

Start by copying a filename in here, then replace all junk
data by {junk}. Next, replace metadata (tags) with {tags}
indicators. You may use the following:
  {tags} for unsorted/unorganized tags
  {tagsGen} for tags/General
  {tagsSrc} for tags/Source
  {tagsChr} for tags/Characters
  {tagsArt} for tags/Artists

When using the {junk} indicator, make sure that there's a
special combination of characters following it that does
not occur where the junk data is. If the filename is:
     Konachan.com - junk data tags tags tags
then using a mask like this would probably botch it:
     Konachan.com - {junk} {tags}
...since the space separating {junk} and {tags} occurs
between "junk" and "data" in the original filename. Thus,
the word "data" would be read as a tag.

The actual filename of konachan images is:
     Konachan.com - 32759 - unsorted tags etc 279.jpg
There's no way to remove the 279 at the end, but...
     {tagsSrc} - {junk} - {tags}
...will store Konachan.com as source, ignore the image
number as junk, and store the rest as unsorted tags.

Thus, be careful when you use the {junk} indicator, as it
may confuse SS. Using it on single words with a special,
rarely used character following should be alright.
