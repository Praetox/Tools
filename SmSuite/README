IMPORTANT! If SMSuite flickers (happens on some computers), just delete
alpha.png. This will make SMSuite fall back to opaque rendering, which
basically means it will look less awesome.

To adjust the configuration of SMSuite, please edit the config.txt file.
...yeah, I haven't added this feature yet. It's locked at 10 fps.

To customize the appearance of SMSuite (change data fields, colours etc),
modify skin.txt and/or replace skin.png. Remember to keep skin.png at a
reasonable size; too large skins will make it slow down your computer.

Also, praetox.com for moar
